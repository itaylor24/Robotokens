# Robotokens

Robotokens is a full stack application that allows users to build NFT Robots that compete in an arena. 

Created using React, Node.js (with Socket.io), Solidity, Ethers, Hardhat, Pi Network, and Unity

# Inspiration

We started with idea generation over a month ago. This idea seemed to have enormous potential and so we unanimously decided prior to the start of the hackathon to pursue this idea. This way we could start coding as soon as 8pm hit on Friday night.

# What it does

In our modern world, unfortunately there’s been a trend in which NFTs have been widely and frequently misused through the implementation of intrinsically valueless tokens. Essentially, people get rich off of sometimes meaningless images or text.

Robotokens is a trailblazer in functional NFTs. Instead of the NFT just being a static image or metadata that has no purpose, RoboTokens’ groundbreaking technology allows users to create digital robots embedded in NFTs that interact with each other and can even generate passive income.

A RoboToken is a user-defined script that holds your robot’s instructions on how to fight other robots in our virtual arena. Users can bet money on robot matches globally, and when a robot wins, all the users that bet money on that robot and the owner of the robot receive compensation. Essentially, your NFT is no longer just an image but is an AI that lives on the blockchain and generates you passive income.

# How we built it

We had one developer focus on the Unity side (Tyrin-Ian Todd) for rendering the robot matches, one focus on front end, another on back end, and the last on the blockchain side. We used GitHub to synchronize our work efforts.

# Challenges we ran into

Integrating Unity into React was a brief roadblock. We had issues with pushing to GitHub. We faced problems with linking Infura and Truffle when it comes to implementing our personalized ERC-721 RoboTokens NFTs.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

The whole project! It was a lot of work and everyone barely slept. We're also proud of our personalized IDE and interpreter.

# What we learned

We learned about web sockets and how to use them in a very limited time period. We learned about connecting web players with blockchain and how to integrate Unity with React.

# What's next for RoboTokens

Implementation of zero knowledge proofs, governance DAO through our personalized DAO coin, and making our language turring complete. We also aspire to add sensing for robots.
